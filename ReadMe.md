# Godot Grid Movement Practice

A little practice project with Godot to familiarize myself with the engine.

Mostly trying to see if I can figure out how to implement features and mechanics
resembling tactical RPG's (mainly Final Fantasy Tactics).


## To Do
- Implement obstacle tile and Navigate2D for unit
- Figure out how to limit unit movement to a certain number of tiles
- Figure out other todo's
